# A Tidy Approach to Text Analysis in R
Text analysis has become increasingly accessible in R. The recent development of the tidytext package, built on the foundation of the tidyverse, continues this trend. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of text analysis in R consistent with the underlying philosophy of the tidyverse, including basic counts, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Basic fluency in R and the tidyverse is expected (e.g., see the [tutorial on R and the tidyverse](https://github.com/marcdotson/introduction-to-r)). 

Participants should have setup a free account at [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) prior to the tutorial.
